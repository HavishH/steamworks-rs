# NetworkingMessages Example

This example demonstrates how to use the NetworkingMessages API to send and receive messages over the network. It sends
the mouse position to all friends playing the same game. Green circle is your local player and red circles are your 
friends.

## Note
To use this example, you need to have two instances on two machines with two steam accounts running at the same time.
